       <h2 class="dark">The History of Jehovah Perazim Christian Fellowship (JPCF) (Lord of the Breakthrough)</h2>
       <br>
       Jehovah Perazim Christian Fellowship (JPCF) was founded by the hand of God through 
       the obedience of Pastor Thomas Bright, Minister Sharon Bright, Pastor Bessie Scott and, Pastor                      Teresa Gatlin, They all accepted the calling of the Holy Spirit to take a giant leap of faith and                      begin a Bible-based, nondenominational ministry; thus the founding of JPCF. With only 4                      members the ministry started and the faith walk began. .Services were held each Sunday at                      the home of Senior Pastor Bright and Minister Sharon Bright for approximately eight weeks. In                      December 2006, Pastor Bright was given a prophetic Word from God that JPCF would have a                      place of Worship without paying rent. Through a chance meeting Pastor Bright spoke to Ms.                      Tinney a neighbor who offered her business building for the ministry's use. In January 2007,
     JPCF was incorporated as a charitable Non-Profit organization and received its 501 (c) (3) status.                      In January 2008, after a church-wide fast, it was prophesized that JPCF would move into a new                      building without using any tithes or offerings so God would be glorified. To God be the glory as                      this prophetic word came to pass. We are extremely grateful to God for the many people who                      willingly support JPCF in the up-building of God's kingdom on earth through the spreading of                      the Good News of Jesus Christ. Jehovah Perazim Christian Fellowship is grateful for its present                      ministries and the many ministries to come in order that God's will be done on the earth as it is in                      heaven. May the peace that transcends all understanding be yours as we welcome you to join                    us in worship, fellowship and ministry in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
